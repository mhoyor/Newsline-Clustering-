# Newsline-Clustering-
This is a project that shows clustering of newsline based on keywords. This newsline was gotten from Kaggle and is constantly updated but for this project we have decided to cull out a few from the newsline 
You can input your own news line at the end, make it at least two sentences. It can be more. So as to get a perfect cluster for your newsline.
